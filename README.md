This is a generator that makes a random fake person description.

The generator assigns a name, and random stat values, that it uses to determine what it should display.

It uses the created stat values to also give a random concern.

The random concerns are questions that a potential investigator to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints might have.

This can be used (very roughly) as an exercise, such as making a lesson to teach this example person.


The .exe version can be downloaded and used through command prompt or other such command line.

This was written in C++.
